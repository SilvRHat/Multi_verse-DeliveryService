// This is the home of Mv-DSR3 [Multi_verse DeliveryServiceRobot #3] or 3MɅ (Pronounced E-mah)
// 3MɅ's was the third robot designed by the ghost Noir, who had spent several months on gathering
// materials and designing special technology for multiverse jumping. Noir had come across unique
// glass lens which mirrored the intersection of human and spirit universes, which allowed her to
// interact with the human world as a ghost spirit. With a passion in robotics and inventing, she
// discovered a method of locating multiversed intersections using special lens and had set out to
// create 3MɅ. 3MɅ was created to traverse the multiverses and had on its own found a passion in
// delivering mail as the sole Multi-Verse Delivery service.

// Traveling through a particularly tech-like city, 3MɅ had discovered a Multiverse Jump to an empty
// world with a constant breeze and beautiful sky - an aviator's bliss. This is now the home of 3MɅ
// and the Multi_verse DeliveryService
