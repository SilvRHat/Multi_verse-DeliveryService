// LORE
// The City of Sight is a home to many inventors and envisionists for remarkable technologies - earning it the name 
// 'City of Sight'. One of them, being the ghost Noir - a quirky, full-of-life soul who specializes in bringing
// robots to life. Nothing is quite like being a ghost in the perspective of Noir who surfs atop airships to just
// jump off and perform an array of flips. Noir also dabbles in the art of lensing - using an assortment of lens
// to show special visuals. She has even used lensing to look into other verses part of a Multi_verse filled with
// all kinds of worlds of different styles.
